This code was for the 3rd nonlinear susceptibility calculations for the Lyman-alpha laser (121 nm) for the ALPHA collaboration at CERN.  

To generate 121 nm light, a 365 nm laser goes through a Kr-Ar gas cell.  A portion of the light will undrgo triple harmonic generation, 
and the nonlinear susceptibility value (chi) determines the amount.

An alternative way to generate 121 nm light is setting up a 243 nm beam to go through the Kr+Ar gas cell under an electric field.  This
process is called electric field-induced second harmonic generation (EFISHG). 

For both processes, the chi values are calculated for a range of incoming wavelengths, and the graphs are shown as well.
